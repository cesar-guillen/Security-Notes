Cloud computing refers to accessing computing resources via a different location than your local computer. In most cases, through the internet.

## Cloud Delivery Models
One of the ways that we can classify cloud services is by what type of resources they provide to their customers. These are the *cloud delivery models* there are three main models:

1. **Software as a Service**: Any software or app provided to users over the Internet. Normally accessed with a web browser. An example of a *SaaS* is Gmail. 
2. **Platform as a Service**: Offers customers a preconfigured computing platform they can use as needed. Serverless computing an example of *PaaS*, such as amazon lambda, you provide the software and the execution instructions.
3. **Infrastructure as a Service**: Provides customers with access to hardware in a self-managed platform. Unlike *PaaS*, *IaaS* customers are responsible for software and OS updates. ^3a64b8

## Cloud Deployment Models
The second way that we can categorize cloud services is by their *cloud deployment model*. This describes where they reside and who may use them. 

1. **Public Cloud**: Third-party companies like Amazon. They provide similar services to everyone willing to pay for them. 
2. **Private Cloud**: offerings are created for use by a single customer. Can be self-made or rented by a service provider.
3. **Community Cloud**: Services shared by a group of customers with shared interests. They could each provide resources for the cloud and only orgs within the community would have access to them. 
4. **Hybrid Cloud**: Combine offerings from two or more deployment models. These retain separate identities to help protect resources in private clouds. 
5. **Multi-Cloud**: combine resources from two or more cloud service providers. Example customer uses *IaaS* from AWS and Microsoft, both are public providers so its not Hybrid.

## Application Programming Interfaces
An *application programming interface (API)* is a software component that gives developers access to features or data within another application, service or OS. Commonly targeted by attackers so security methods should be in place.

* **Authentication**: Strong authentication methods will prevent unauthorized entities from using the APIs. 
* **Authorization**: methods to secure access to the API, developers may be able to act in a different way than a administrator. 
* **Transport Level Security**: The API should use strong security, such as [[2. Protocol Use Cases#^775643|TLS]]. 

## Microservices and APIs
*Microservices* are code modules designed to one thing well. They typically receive values, process them and respond with an output. A microservice module is not tied to any specific business. This allows developers to use it in different applications without modifying it. For example you enter a package ID and you get displayed information about the delivery.  

## Managed Security Service Provider
A *managed security service provider (MSSP)* is a third-party vendor that provides security services for smaller companies. MSSPs may provide the following services:

* Patch Management
* Vulnerability Scanning
* VPNs and proxy services
* Firewalls, IDS and IPS

A *managed service provider (MSP)* provides any IT services needed by an organization, including security services provided by an MSSP. ^577d23

## Cloud Service Provider Responsibilities
There are different responsibilities for the *Cloud Service Provider (CSP)* and the customer depending on the model being used.

## On-Premise Versus Off-Premise
Organizations can use cloud resources on-premises or off-premises. On-premises indicates that all resources are owned, operated and maintained within the organization's properties. Public clouds are always off-premises.

* **On-Premise**: Company has to control everything, more control over security and can implement tailored authentication like SSO. Can be ***centralized*** which reduces costs or ***decentralized*** which reduces the single point of failure problem.
* **Off-Premise**: Les control over where data is stored which could mean that its stored in different country with different laws, but we do not need to maintain the service.

## Hardening Cloud Environments
Cloud security is critical to companies so here are some of the ways they protect their data.

* **Cloud Access Security Broker**: A *CASB* is a software solutions deployed between an organization and a CSP. It monitors traffic and ensures that security policies are being used.
* **Cloud-Based DLP**: Implements [[3. Protecting Data#Data Loss Prevention|DLP]] policies for data stored in the cloud. For example it ensures that Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is encrypted.
* **Next-Generation Secure Web Gateway**: An *SWG* is a combination of a [[4. Implementing Network Designs#Proxy Servers|proxy server]] and a [[3. Basic Network Infrastructure#Firewalls|firewall]]. The *SWG* is usually a cloud-based service, btu it can be on-site. Clients are configured to access the Internet via the *SWG*, has same restrictions as a proxy or firewall.
* **Cloud Firewall Considerations**: CSP have advanced firewalls, if you still need to change it you will need to use *security groups* which offer the ability to change firewall rules that affect only your resources and not the other clients using the same CSP.

## Edge and Fog Computing
*Edge computing* is the practice of storing and processing data close to the devices that generate and use the data. Many non-edge solutions store all the data in the cloud, requiring round trips to retrieve and process the data. However, this takes too much time for many situations.

*Fog computing* is almost the same thing as edge computing. The primary difference is that fog computing uses a network close to the device and may have multiple nodes sensing and processing data within the fog network. In contrast, edge computing stores and processes the data on single nodes or appliances.

## Software-Defines Networking
*Software-defined networking (SDN)* uses virtualization technologies to route traffic instead of using hardware routers and switches. More and more cloud service providers are implanting SDNs as part of an overall [[4. Summarizing Cloud Concepts#^3a64b8|IaaS]] solution.
