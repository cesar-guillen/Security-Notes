Secure systems design concepts help ensure that computing systems are deployed and maintained in a secure state.

## Endpoint Security Software
Endpoints are computing devices such as servers, [[1. Virtualization|VMs]], desktops, [[6. Exploring Embedded Systems#Understanding Internet of Things|IoT devices]]. These endpoints often contain sensitive information. They are commonly targeted by attacker, here are some categories for endpoint security:

* **Antivirus Software** This software scans endpoints for the presence of [[2. Determining Malware Types#^523c87|viruses]], [[2. Determining Malware Types#^c245ac|worms]], and malicious code. The software will detect, contain and eliminate the malicious program.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** Security technology that focusses on detecting and responding to threats at the endpoint level. Much more advanced than a regular AV with more features. 
* **Extended Detection and Response (XDR)** Next-generation security technology, covers the ***entire*** IT environment (cloud, IoT, network devices) and detects and responds to threats.
* [[1. Advanced Security Devices#HIDS|Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)]] Applies intrusion detection to a single host or endpoint. 

## Hardening Workstation and Servers
Hardening is the practice of making an operating system (OS) or application more secure from its default installation. 

When deploying a system it should only have the application, services and protocols they need to meet their purpose. Otherwise, you are giving attackers more surface to attack. 

## Secure Baselines and Integrity Measurements 
A *baseline* is a known starting points, and orgs commonly use secure baselines to provide known starting points for systems. Weak configurations is a common issue, secure baselines help eliminate it. The use of baselines works in three steps:

1. **Establish an initial baseline configuration**
2. **Deploy the baseline** 
3. **Maintain the baseline**

## Using Master Images for Baseline Configurations
 One of the most used methods of deploying systems is with images starting with a master images. An image is a [[1. Virtualization#Snapshots|snapshot]] of a single system that administrators deploy to multiple other systems.

1. Administrators start with a blank source system. They ***install*** and ***configure*** the OS, modify setting and perform strict ***testing*** to ensure that is is secure. 
2. Administrators then capture an image which becomes their ***master*** ***image***. The image is a file which can be copied to any data storage medium
3. Lastly, administrators ***deploy*** the image to multiple systems, the image ***installs*** the same configuration on the target systems as the original source system.

## Patching and Patch Management
Administrators must apply these *patches* to keep their systems up-to-date and protected against known vulnerabilities. 

*Patch management* ensures that systems and applications stay up-to-date with current patches. This is one of the most efficient ways to reduce operating system and application vulnerabilities. Administrators often test updates in sandbox environments such as a VM. After testing them admins will deploy them.  They normally use third-party apps to deploy the patches in a controlled manner. [[6. Network Access Control#Host Health Checks| NAC]] can be used to verify that hosts in your network are up-to-date.

## Change Management
*Change management* defines the process for any type of system modifications or upgrades, including changes to applications. For example a dummy admin that changes the IP address of a printer to the same IP address as the DNS server (bad). Change management provides two key goals:

1. To ensure changes to IT system do not result in unintended outages or security flaws
2. To provide an accounting structure or methods to document all changes

If an administrator wants to change an IP address he or she will instead need to send a formal request detailing the change and it will need to get accepted by an expert.

## Application Allow or Block Lists
*White and Black lists* for applications, administrators will block or allow certain applications to be downloaded on a system, if an application gets blocked it can be placed on quarantine and placed in a protected area so that the administrator can examine it later. 

## Disk Encryption
*Full disk encryption (FDE)* encrypts an entire disk. This can be done by built-in technology like BitLocker or FileVault, third-party apps like VeraCrypt also work in the same way.

Hardware vendors are now manufacturing *self-encrypting drives (SEDs)* also known as hardware-based FDE drives. SEDs include encryption circuitry built into the drive. Disk gets decrypted when user types the password to login. 

## Boot Integrity
These processes verify the integrity of the OS and boot loading systems. I.e. it can verify that the files have not changed. 

A *measured boot* goes through enough of the boot process to perform these checks without allowing a user to interact with the system. If it detects that [[1. Core Security Goals#^aed5c3|integrity]] has been lost it won't boot. 

##### Boot Security and UEFI
Newer systems use *Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)* which performs many of the same functions as the ***BIOS*** but provides some enhancements. It can boot from larger disks, and is CPU independent. 

Both BIOS and UEFI can be upgraded using a process called flashing. Flashing overwrites the firmware within the chip with newer software.

##### Trusted Platform Module
*A Trusted Platform Module (TPM)* is a hardware chip included in many desktops and laptops. It provides full disk encryption support and features a *secure boot* process and *remote attestation* which sends a report to a remote system, which verifies the report and the integrity. The endorsement key is a unique asymmetric key pair burned into the TPM chip that provides a hardware root of trust.

##### Hardware Security Module
A *hardware security module (HSM)* is a removable or external device that can generate, store, and manage keys used in asymmetric encryption. Many server-based applications use an HSM to protect keys. A microSD HSM is an HSM device installed on a microSD card and can be installed on any device with a microSD or SD slot. The difference between a TPM and HSM is that that HSM is removable

## Decommissioning and Disposal
Hardware that has to be retired has to be wiped of all memory, credentials and temporary files to prevent credentials theft. Policies must be made to ensure this is accomplished. After cleaning the hardware from its memory it should either be destroyed or securely disposed of.

*Legacy hardware* refers to older computer hardware that is not longer manufactured. *End-of-life (EOL) hardware* refers to hardware that has reached the end of its useful life, either because it is no longer being supported by the manufacturer or because it is too outdated to meet current technology standards. EOL hardware is also not receiving patches or updates meaning its vulnerable to attackers. To mitigate risks three actions must be taken.

1. Develop a comprehensive plan for managing legacy and EOL hardware, including regular assessments of hardware inventory and a plan for decommissioning devices that are no longer needed.  
2. Prioritize the security of these devices by implementing security controls such as firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems, and monitoring them closely for signs of suspicious activity.  
3. Consider upgrading to newer hardware and software whenever possible to ensure that IT infrastructure remains secure and up to date.
