This section describes attacks directed to networks and how to identify them

## Denial of Service Attacks
A *denial-of-service (DOS)* attack is an attack from one attacker against one target. A *distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)* attack is an attack from two or more computers against a single target. The goal of both is ***resources exhaustion***. 

An indicator of a network-based DDoS attack is a sustained, abnormally high amount of network traffic on the NIC of the attacked computer. Another indicator is high usage of other system resources such as the processor or memory. 

There are two major variants of a DDoS attack.

1. **Reflected DDoS**: Sending requests to a third-party server with the source IP of the target, when the third-party sends the response it sends it to the target.
2. **Amplified DDoS**: Uses the above attack but also uses requests that send back a lot of traffic thereby amplifying the attack. 

## SYN Flood Attacks
The *SYN flood* attack is a common DoS or DDoS attack used against servers. The objective is to exhaust the server's resources by leaving half-open connections. This is done using the TCP three-way handshake, the attack will send a SYN packet, the server will respond with the appropriate SYN, ACK packets but the attack will not reply back with the ACK packet, this leaves the server waiting for the response and keeping the connection open. Draining its resources.

## Forgery
*Forgery* attacks occur when an attacker creates a ***fake identity***, certificate, file or other object in an attempt to fool an unsuspecting victim or system. *Spoofing* is an example of forgery and it happens when an attacker impersonates someone or something else. Spoofing can be used to:

* Change the sender's email address
* Change the source IP to hide the attacker's IP
* Spoof the MAC address to appear as a trusted system.

## On-Path Attacks
An *on-path attack* also known as a *man-in-the-middle (MTM)* attack is a form of active interception and modification, or active monitoring. The attacker can then control, change or insert malicious code in the conversation.

A sophisticated MTM attack can intercept encrypted traffic, decrypt it, read it, and encrypt it again to send it to the intended receiver.

Because traffic has to do an additional hop, traffic may be delayed, even more if the attacker has to perform encryption and decryption. When secure channels are used, the on-path system may use certificates that aren’t issued by a [[5. Exploring PKI Components#Certificate Authority|CA]] and will generate certificate warnings. SSH gives a warning if previously established keys have changed.

## Secure Sockets Layer Stripping.
An *SSL stripping attack* changes an encrypted Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) connection to an unencrypted Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) connection. These days, HTTPS uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) instead of SSL but the name SSL stripping has stuck around.

The browser will give a warning saying the connection is not secure.

## DNS Attacks
DNS suffers from a large number of attacks here are the most common:

* **DNS Poisoning Attacks**: A DNS poisoning attack attempts to modify DNS data that is stored on a DNS server. For example, a successful DNS poisoning attack can modify the IP address associated with google.com and replace it with a malicious website’s IP address. Prevented with [[2. Protocol Use Cases#DNSSEC|DNSSEC]]  ^908174
* **Pharming Attack**: Similar to DNS Poisoning but instead modifies the hosts file used in Windows or Linux instead of the DNS Server.
* **URL Redirection**: Redirecting a user to a malicious website.
* **Domain Hijacking**: An attacker changes a domain name registration without permission from the owner.
* **DNS Sinkholes**: Administrators may use *DNS filtering* to control the websites that users visit. DNS filtering uses block lists of known malicious domain names. A *DNS Sinkhole* are incorrect DNS filtering results, user requests to legitimate websites will be dropped.

## Replay Attacks
Replay attacks capture data in a session to impersonate one of the parties in the session. Timestamps, sequence numbers, and multi-factor authentication are effective countermeasures against replay attacks.
