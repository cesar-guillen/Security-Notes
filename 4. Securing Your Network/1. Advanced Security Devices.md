This section explores many of the more advanced security devices used to secure networks from chapter three.

## Understanding IDSs and IPSs
Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) monitor a network and send alerts when they detect suspicious events on a system or network. Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) react to attacks in progress and prevent them from reaching systems and networks.

##### HIDS
A *host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS)* is additional software installed on a system which monitors the individual host.  For a *HIDS*, this traffic passes through the NIC. Many *HIDS* have expanded to monitor application activity on the system.  *HIDS* are installed to also see if the antivirus missed something.

##### NIDS
A *network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS)* monitors activity on the network. An admin installs NIDS sensors or collectors on network devices such as switches, routers or firewalls. These collect data and report back to the central monitoring system hosting the NIDS console. 

##### Detection Methods
An IDS can only detect and attack but not prevent it. There are two main detection methods, which are, signature-based and heuristic-, behavioral-based or Trend-based. 

1. **Signature-based**: Has a database of known vulnerabilities and attack patterns and filters them out.
2. **Trend-based Detection**: Identifies normal network operations, when the IDS detects abnormal activity it flags it. This method is better at finding ***Zero-day exploits***.

##### Data Sources and Trends
Data sources like logs inside of a [[5. Logging and Monitoring#Centralized Logging and Monitoring|SIEM]] can be used to aggregate the data making it easier to analyze. An IDS can then analyze these log entries to provide information about trends and detect a pattern.

##### Reporting based on Rules
