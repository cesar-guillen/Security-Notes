A virtual private network (VPN) is often used for remotes access. Remote access VPNs allow users to access private networks via a public network. 

Access over a public network is a core security concern with VPNs. With more people working from home and connecting to company networks via direct access.

Different tunneling protocols encapsulate and encrypt the traffic to protect the data from unauthorized disclosure. The tunnel prevents anyone from reading the data transferred through it. 

## VPNs and VPN Concentrators
It is possible to create a VPN by enabling services on a server, for example in a Windows Server, you can enable the Direct Access VPN role. If you are only supporting a few VPN clients this is a good solution.

Larger organizations may use a *VPN concentrator*, which is a dedicated device used for VPNs. A VPN concentrator includes all the services needed to create a VPN, including strong encryption and authentication techniques and can support many more clients.

When using a VPN concentrator, you would place it on the [[4. Implementing Network Designs#Screened Subnet|screened subnet]]. The firewall between the internet and the DMZ would forward VPN traffic to the VPN concentrator which would in turn, route all private VPN traffic to the second firewall between the DMZ and the ***intranet***. 

## Remote Access VPN
The VPN client first connects to the Internet using a broadband connection to the ISP. After connecting to the internet, the VPN client can the initiate the VPN connection.

The VPN server is in the DMZ and reachable through a public IP address. This makes it accessible from any other host on the Internet. A VPN server needs to authenticate clients and a common way to do it is with a RADIUS server. 

The RADIUS server can contain a database with users but its most commonly used to pass the auth request to an LDAP server.
