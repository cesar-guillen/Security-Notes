An important step when implementing a VPN is to ensure only authorized entities can access it

## PAP 
*Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)* is used with *Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)* to authenticate clients. A weakness of PAP is that it sends the credentials in cleartext. Very weak and not commonly used nowadays.

## Chap
*Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)* also uses PPP and authenticates remote users. CHAP is more secure than PAP because it does not send the credentials in cleartext, instead it uses a shared secret and hash in combination with a nonce.

## RADIUS
*Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)* is a centralized authentication service.  Instead of each individual VPN server needing a separate database to identify who can authenticate, the VPN servers forward the authentication requests to a central RADIUS server. RADIUS can also be used as an 802.1X server with [[3. Securing Wireless Networks#WPA2 and CCMP|WPA2]] or [[3. Securing Wireless Networks#WPA3 and Simultaneous Authentication of Equals|WPA3]] Enterprise mode

The company could use a centralized RADIUS server instead. Each VPN server is configured with a shared secret (like a password) and the RADIUS server is configured with a matching shared secret for each of the VPN servers. This can then be later forwarded to the DC's LDAP server.

## TACACS+
Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+) is an alternative to RADIUS, and it provides two essential security benefits over RADIUS. First, it encrypts the entire authentication process, whereas RADIUS encrypts only the password by default. Second, TACACS+ uses multiple challenges and responses between the client and the server.
