Allowing remote access to your private network can expose your network to many risks from the clients. If a user logs on to a VPN with a malware-infected computer, this computer can then infect other computers on the internal network. *Network access control (NAC)* methods provide continuous security monitoring by inspecting computers and preventing them from accessing the network if they donâ€™t pass the inspection.

Administrators have full control over computers on their network but they cannot control the computer the employee is using to connect from home with a [[5. Using VPNs for Remote Access|VPN]]. *NAC* provides a measure of control for these other computers. 

## Host Health Checks
Admins have a checklist of conditions that the client must meet before connecting to the network some of them include:

* The client's firewall is enabled
* The client's operating system is up to date and ahs all the current patches and fixes
* The client's [[4. Blocking Malware and Other Attacks#Antivirus and Anti-Malware Software|antivirus software]] is up to date and has all the updated signature definitions 

NAC systems use authentication agents or health agents to inspect NAC agents. When a CPN client accesses the network, the VPN server will query the NAC health server to determine the ***health conditions***, if the clients meets them they are allowed into the intranet otherwise they will be redirected to the *Remediation Network* which includes resources that the client can use to get healthy. The NAC health server can also be used to check the health of internal computers.

## Agent Versus Agentless NAC
There are two types of agents 
1. **Permanent**: The client downloads them and they stay on the system
2. **Dissolvable**: When the remote session begins, the agent gets downloaded, the agent will then report to the NAT and uninstall itself immediately or after the session ends.

An Agentless NAC works more like a vulnerability scanner, the client does not have to download anything so the process gets done remotely
