*Biometrics* measure some physical characteristic of the user to confirm their identity. Biometrics are the **strongest** authentication methods because an attacker cannot falsify them as easily. 

* Fingerprints
* Vein Matching/Palm Scanners
* Retina Imaging (Scans the blood vessels in the eye)
* Iris Scanners (Scans the iris's pattern)
* Facial Recognition
* Voice Recognition
* Galt Analysis (How they walk)

> [!REMEMBER]
> Retina and Iris Scanning is the strongest biometric authentication, Iris scanning is preferred as it does not need physical contact.

##### Biometric Efficacy Rates
The biometric *efficacy* rate refers to the performance of the system under ideal conditions.

* False acceptance: accepted bad guy
* False rejection: rejected good guy
* True acceptance: accepted good guy
* True rejection: rejected bad guy

- **FRR (False Rejection Rate):** The rate at which the system incorrectly rejects an authorized user.
- **FAR (False Acceptance Rate):** The rate at which the system incorrectly accepts an unauthorized user.
- **CER (Crossover Error Rate):** The point at which the **FRR and FAR are equal**. It represents the overall accuracy of the biometric system.
    

> [!NOTE]
> **A lower CER means the biometric system is more accurate**, because it indicates both fewer false rejections and fewer false acceptances.
