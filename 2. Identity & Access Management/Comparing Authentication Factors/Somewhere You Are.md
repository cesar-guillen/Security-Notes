The *somewhere you are* authentication attribute identifies a user’s location. Geolocation is a group of technologies used to identify a user’s location and is the most common method used in this factor. Many authentication systems use the Internet Protocol (IP) address for geolocation. The IP address provides information on the country, region, state, city, and sometimes even the zip code.

If the IP address is coming from a location where the employee is not residing it can get blocked. VPNs can be used to attack this but the VPN IP will get detected. MAC addresses can be used inside the company, can be used so users can only login to certain computers.
