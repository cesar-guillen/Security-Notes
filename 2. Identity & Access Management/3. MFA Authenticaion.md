*Two-factor authentication* (sometimes called dual-factor authentication) uses two different authentication factors: something you have and something you know, or something you know and something you are. Some examples of two-factor authentication include:

* A soft token (something you have) and a password (something you know) 
* A fingerprint scan (something you are) and a PIN (something you know) 
* A security key (something you have) and a retinal scan (something you are)

Itâ€™s worth noting that using two methods of authentication in the same factor is not two-factor authentication. For example, using a thumbprint and a retina scan is not two-factor authentication because both methods are in the something you are factor. 

> [!REMEMBER]
> Using two or more methods in the same factor of authentication (such as a PIN and a password) is single-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication uses two ***different*** authentication factors, such as using a hardware token and a PIN. Multifactor authentication uses two or more ***different*** factors.

## Passwordless Authentication
Users dislike passwords, and passwords are one of the least secure ways to authenticate, so many organizations are trying to get rid of them entirely. *Passwordless authentication* approaches eliminate passwords and replace them with other authentication factors, such as something you have or something you are.
