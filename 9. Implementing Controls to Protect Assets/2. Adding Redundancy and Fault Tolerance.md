One constant with technology is that it will always fail at some point. Adding *redundancy* to your systems and networks can increase the reliability and availability of the system. 

*Redundancy* adds duplication to critical system components and networks and provides *fault tolerance*. This means that a system can still work after being affected by a fault. Redundancies can be used on [[1. Core Security Goals#1. Redundancy and Fault Tolerance|these systems]]
