One constant with technology is that it will always fail at some point. Adding *redundancy* to your systems and networks can increase the reliability and availability of the system. 

*Redundancy* adds duplication to critical system components and networks and provides *fault tolerance*. This means that a system can still work after being affected by a fault. Redundancies can be used on [[1. Core Security Goals#1. Redundancy and Fault Tolerance|these systems]]

## Disk Redundancies
The disk is the most susceptible to failure. Because of this, administrators often upgrade disk subsystems to improve their performance and redundancy.

A *redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID)* subsystem provides fault tolerance for disks and increases system availability. Even if a disk fails, most RAID subsystems can tolerate the failure. 

* **RAID-0**: Kind of bad, does not provide redundancy or fault tolerance. Provides more physical disks, files are spread across the disks, increase writing and reading speeds.
* **RAID-1**: Uses two disk (*mirroring*). Data written to one disk is also written to the other disk.
* **RAID-5**: Uses three or more disks that are striped together, similar to RAID-0. However, the equivalent of one drive includes ***parity information***. If one drive fails, the disk subsystem can read the remaining drives' information and re-create the original data. If two or more drives fail, data will be lost.
* **RAID-6**: Very similar to RAID-5 but uses an additional parity block and requires an additional disk. The benefit is that it can continue to operate if two disks fail. Requires at least 4 disks.

## Server Redundancy and High Availability
*High availability* refers to a system or service that needs to remain operational with almost zero down time. We tend to aim for the "five nines", 99.999% uptime. That is only 6 minutes per year of downtime. High-capacity load balancers ensure the service is always available even if a server fails.

##### Active/Active Load Balancers
An **active/active load balancer** can optimize and distribute data loads across multiple computers or networks. Load-balancing distributes traffic equally among all the servers in the ***web farm***. Source IP address affinity scheduling ensures clients are redirected to the same server for an entire session. Some just send the in a round-robin fashion. Load balancers can be hardware or software.

##### Active/Passive Load Balancers
Load balancers can also be configured in an active/passive configuration. In an active/passive configuration, one server is active, and the other server is inactive. If the active server fails, the inactive server takes over.

## NIC Teaming
*NIC teaming* allows you to group two or more physical network adapters into a single software0based virtual network adapter. This increases the capacity of the server and it also uses load balancing to distribute outgoing traffic equally among the NICs. This also increases the tolerance of the system because if one NIC fails the others can take over.

## Power Redundancies
Power is a critical utility to consider. For mission-critical systems, you can use uninterruptable power supplies, generators, and managed power distribution units (PDUs) to provide fault tolerance and high availability.

* **Uninterruptable power supplies (UPS)**:  Provides short-term power and protects against power fluctuations. It is used temporarily while waiting for more long-term power to come. 
* **Dual supply**: A second power supply that can power a deice if the primary power supply fails. Most redundant power supplies are hot-swappable (can replace the fail without removing power from the system)
* **Generators**: Long-term power during extended outages. 
* **Managed power distribution units (PDUs)**: Used in data centers to distribute power to devices in racks (ladrones). Managed PDUs give information like voltage etc can be used by administrators to track the status of the data center.
