In addition to malware, it’s important to understand some other common attacks. Social engineering includes several techniques attackers use to trick users.

## Social Engineering and Human Vectors
*Human vectors* may also be the source of cybersecurity risks. *Social engineering* uses social tactics to trick users into giving up information or performing actions they wouldn’t normally take. Social engineering attacks can occur in person, over the phone, while surfing the Internet, and via email.

* **Impersonation**: The goal is to convince an authorized user to provide some information or help the attacker defeat a security control. 

* **Shoulder Surfing**: Simply looking over the shoulder of someone to gain information. 

* **Disinformation**: An attacker will provide fake information to their target in order to influence them to take some action or disclose some information. 

* **Tailgating**: Following closely one person to gain access to a restricted area. Can be stopped with mantraps (the metro thingy) so that only one person can pass at a time.

* **Dumpster Diving**: Searching through trash or container to gain information from discarded documents. Many organizations shred or burn paper because of this.

* **Watering Hole Attacks**: Attempts to discover websites a group of people are likely to visit. The attacker will then infect the website and then the malware can infect the visitors. 

* **Business Email Compromise**: *BEC* is a type of targeted attack that seeks to exploit the trust and authority of high-level executives. Attackers will impersonate an executive and request sensitive information or authorize a payment. 

* **Typosquatting**: Buying a domain name that is similar to a legitimate domain name. Done often for either hosting a malicious site, earning ad revenue or reselling the domain.

* **Brand Impersonation**: Impersonating a trusted brand by copying the name and logo, attackers will usually host a website to attack unsuspecting users.

## Message-Based Attacks
Attackers have been using email to launch attacks for years. Here are some of the most common message attacks.

* **Spam**: Unwanted or unsolicited email. Some spam email i just ads but others can have malicious links, code or attachments.  *Spam Over Instant Messaging SPIM* is similar but is done over *Instant Messaging (IM)* apps.
* **Phishing**: The practice of sending email to users with the purpose of tracking them into revealing personal information. For example by sending them to a fake website to type in their passwords.
	* Spear fishing targets specific people. Use of *digital signatures* to verify the sender
	* Whaling targets executives
* **Vishing**: Trick users into giving up personal and financial information. Vishing often uses [[2. Protocol Use Cases#Voice and Video|Voice over IP (VoIP)]] technology allowing the attacker to spoof caller ID, making it appear as though the call came from a real company. Some attempts are fully automated, others are semi-automated.
* **Smishing**: A form of phishing that uses text messages instead of emails.
