*Malware* includes a wide range of software that has malicious intent. You would not download it on purpose but it is installed by devious means. Different types of malware have different indicators.

* **Viruses**: Malicious code that *attaches* itself to a host application. Must be *executed* to run. The virus will then replicate itself by finding other host applications to infect. At some point it will activate its real payload.

* **Worms**: *Self-replicating* malware that travels through the network without any assistance. Once a system is infected it will try to infect others, consumes a lot of bandwidth.

* **Logic Bombs**: A logic bomb executes in response to an event, such as when a specific application is executed, or a specific time arrives.

* **Trojans**: A Trojan appears to be something useful but includes a malicious component, such as installing a backdoor on a user’s system. Many Trojans are delivered via drive-by downloads. They can also infect systems with fake antivirus software, pirated software, games, and browser extensions.

* **Remote Access Trojans**: A *RAT* is a type of malware that is downloaded usually by drive-by downloads and once installed attackers can access the computer at any time and can install more malware.

* **Keyloggers**: Captures keystrokes. Used to capture credentials or other information like [[3. MFA Authenticaion|MFA]] codes. The data is kept in a file or directly sent to the attacker.

* **Spyware**: Software installed on user's systems without their knowledge or consent. Used to spy on the user, and are often installed in conjunction with other malware. 

* **Rootkit**:  Rootkits have system-level or kernel access and can modify system files and system access. Rootkits hide their running processes to avoid detection with hooking and similar techniques. Tools that can inspect RAM can discover these hidden hooked processes.

* **Ransomware**: Malware that takes control of a user’s system or data. Criminals then attempt to extort payment from the victim. Ransomware often includes threats of damaging a user’s system or data if the victim does not pay the ransom, and attackers increasingly target hospitals, cities, and other larger organizations.

* **Bloatware**: Pre-installed on a device by the device manufacturer or retailer, Installed without user consent, and are generally considered undesirable due to negative impact on system performance, Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP) is more severe and can damage the system.

## Potential Indicators of a Malware Attack
There are many indicators of malware attacks. Some of them are as follows:

* **Extra Traffic**: Malware generate a lot of traffic, can be compared to normal activities to detect anomalies.
* **Data Exfiltration**: Malware often attempts to exfiltrate data, can be stopped with [[3. Protecting Data#Data Loss Prevention|DLP]]techniques. 
* **Encrypted Traffic**: Malware can encrypt data before sending it. If data is encrypted DLP wont be able to read it, but a large amount of encrypted data is being sent it should be a warning sign.
* **Traffic to Specific IPs**: Bot zombies will often attempt to connect to known control servers. Some are well known and firewalls block them, if firewall logs show high level of blocked connections its an indicator of system compromise.
* **Outgoing Spam**: Desktop computers do not usually send a large amount of emails, if they do its because they have been added to a botnet and are sending phishing emails as zombies.
