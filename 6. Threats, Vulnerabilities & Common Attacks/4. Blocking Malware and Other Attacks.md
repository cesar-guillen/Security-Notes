Administrators commonly implement layered security, or a [[1. Comparing Physical Security Controls#Platform Diversity|defense-in-depth]] plan, to protect against malware. Some of the common security controls are summarized below

## Spam Filters
Organizations have a many layers to protect against spam. Many [[4. Implementing Network Designs#Unified Threat Management|UTM]] systems include spam filters which detect and block them. Mail servers also have methods of detecting blocking spam and user systems also have  anti-spam filters as a final check. 

The challenge of a *spam filter* is to ensure that most spam gets blocked an no legitimate email gets blocked because it could cost a company a lot of money. 

## Antivirus and Anti-Malware Software
Antivirus software detects and removes malware, such as viruses, Trojans, and worms. *Signature-based* antivirus software detects known malware based on signature definitions. *Heuristic-based* antivirus software detects previously unknown malware based on behavior.

* **Signature-based**: Scans files for matching patterns of already known malware exploits.
* **Heuristic-based**: Attempts to detect viruses that were previously unknown and no not have signatures. The antivirus will run the questionable code in a sandbox and look at its behavior.
* **File Integrity Monitors**: Computes baselines hashes for system files and routinely checks for modifications, if they are not the same an alert is sent. Useful for detecting [[2. Determining Malware Types#^2db95b|rootkits]]

## Why Social Engineering Works
Social engineers typically use one or more psychology-based principles to increase the effectiveness of their attacks. The following sections introduce these topics.

* **Authority**: Humans have an innate respect to authority, if an attacker claims to be some higherup users are more likely to follow orders.
* **Intimidation**: Often combine with authority tactics to threaten someone to take an unwanted action.
* **Consensus**: People are more willing to like something that other people like (ratings in uber eats) attackers will fill websites with fake ratings to get people to download [[2. Determining Malware Types#^a2fe9b|trojans]].
* **Scarcity and Urgency**: People are more likely to make mistakes when they act on impulses, both of these tactics make use of it. Scarcity targets items that are hard to find while urgency puts a time limit to perform an action. 
* **Familiarity and Trust**: Humans are more trusting to people we already know or seem trustworthy.

## Threat Intelligence Sources
One common method that attackers often use before launching an attack is to gather information from *open-source intelligence (OSINT)*. In contrast, *closed/proprietary intelligence* refers to trade secrets such as intellectual property. An organization tries to keep these private, but attackers sometimes infiltrate an organization to steal these trade secrets. Some common types of OSINT are:

* **Vulnerability Databases**: Document known vulnerabilities, [[5. Understanding Frameworks & Standards#NIST Frameworks|NIST]], NVD and MITRE's CVEs
* **Trusted Automated eXchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII)**: A standard way for organizations to exchange and share cyber threat information. Does not specify what information organizations should exchange.
* **Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX)**: Open standard that identifies what cyber threat information organizations should share. STIX data is shared via TAXII.
* **Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)**: Used for real-time exchange of threat indicators and defensive measures. Uses both TAXII and STIX.
* **Dark Web**: Criminals often store and sell hacking tools. Some sites provide up-to-date information on known vulnerabilities. 
* **Public/Private Information Sharing Organizations**: Public and private companies sharing information to whoever wants to.
* **Indicators of Compromise (IoC)**: Evidence that a cyberattack is happening or has happened. 
* **Predictive Analysis**: Predictive analysis techniques attempt to predict what attackers will do next and how to thwart their attacks.
* **Threat Maps**: Offer a visual representation of active threats. They typically show a replay of recent attacks rather than real-time data.
* **File/Code Repositories**:  Many repositories include prewritten code that developers can use for a variety of purposes, including gathering intelligence.

## Research Sources
There’s an almost endless list of additional sources that cybersecurity personnel can reference when researching threats.

* **Vendor Websites**: Good source of reliable information on a vendor's products. 
* **Conferences**: Used to share cybersecurity information.
* **Local Industry Group**: A group of people or organizations that work in the same industry willing to share information with each other.
* **Academic Journals**: Professionals also public scholarly articles in academic journals. Used to show research and are peer-reviewed for high credibility.
* **Request for Comments (RFC)**: The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) publishes documents called RFCs for a variety of purposes. Many are Internet standards, and they are the authoritative source of knowledge for technical specifications.
* **Social Media**: Can be good for recent news but can be unreliable.
