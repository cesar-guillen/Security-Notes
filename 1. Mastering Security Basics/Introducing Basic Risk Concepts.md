*Risk* is the possibility or likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability resulting in a loss. A *threat* is any circumstance or event that has the potential to compromise confidentiality, integrity, or availability. A *vulnerability* is a weakness. It can be a weakness in the hardware, the software, the configuration, or even the users operating the system.

If a *threat* (such as an attacker) exploits a *vulnerability*, it can result in a *security incident*. A security incident is an adverse event or series of events that can negatively affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an organizationâ€™s information technology (IT) systems and data.

Reducing *risk* is also known as *risk mitigation*. Risk mitigation reduces the chances that a threat will exploit a vulnerability or the impact that the risk will have on the organization if it does occur. You reduce risks by implementing controls (also called countermeasures and safeguards),
