Control Categories describe how control works.

* **Technical controls** use technology such as hardware, software, and firmware to reduce risk.  
* **Managerial controls** are primarily administrative in function. They are typically documented in an organization’s security policy and focus on managing risk. 
* **Operational controls** help ensure that the day-to-day operations of an organization comply with the security policy. People implement them.
* **Physical controls** impact the physical world, such as locks on doors, fences, security guards, and other objects that you can physically touch.


## Technical Controls

An administrator install and configures the technical control, and it will provide control automatically. 

1. **Encryption**: Strong technical control used to protect confidentiality of data.
2. **AV Software**: Will provide protection against malware
3. **Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs)**:  Will monitor the network for intrusions and provide protection against some threats.
4. **Firewalls**: Restrict network traffic going in an out of ports in a network.
5. **Least Privilege**: Individual or processes are granted only the privileges they need to perform their tasks, but no more.

## Managerial Controls
These controls use planning and assessment methods to review the organization’s ability to reduce and manage risk.

1. **Risk Assessments**:  These help quantify the and qualify risks within an organization so that team members can focus on the primary issues.
2. **Vulnerability Assessments**: A vulnerability assessment attempts to discover current vulnerabilities. When necessary, additional controls are implemented to reduce the risk from these vulnerabilities.
