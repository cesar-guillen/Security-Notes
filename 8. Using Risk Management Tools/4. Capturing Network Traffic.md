This section discusses tools used to capture network traffic.

## Packet Capture and Replay
*Packet capture* refers to capturing network packets transmitted over a network, and *packet replay* refers to sending packets back out over the network. This can be done with a *protocol analyzer*

Administrators use a *protocol analyzer* to capture, display, and analyze packets sent over a network. It is useful when troubleshooting communication problems between systems. It is also useful to detect attacks that manipulate or fragment packets.

Attackers can also use a *protocol analyzer* to capture data sent across the network in cleartext, this can be done with a [[4. Understanding Wireless Attacks#Rogue Access Point|rogue access point]].

## Protocol Analyzers Examples
* Wireshark
* TCPReplay
* TCPDump
* NetFlow
