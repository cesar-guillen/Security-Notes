*Risk* is the likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability. The result of a risk is a negative impact on the organization,

When evaluating a risk we need to look at two parameters: The ***impact*** and the ***probability*** of that risk occurring.

## Threats
Threats come in different forms, including the following:

* **[[1. Understanding Threat Actors#Threat Actor Types|Malicious  Human Threats]]**: Could be an script kiddie or a professional hacker.
* **Accidental Human Threats**: Users can delete or corrupt data, or accidentally change configurations.
* **Environmental Threats**: This includes long-term power failures, hurricanes, floods, storms.

A *threat assessment* helps an organization identify and categorize threats. Threats are found and labeled by their impact and probability, the organization will implement risk mitigation for the most critical risks.

## Risk Management Strategies
*Risk management* is the practice of identifying, analyzing, monitoring and limiting risks to a manageable level. It ***does not eliminate risks*** but limits or mitigates them. 

##### Terms
There are several basic terms that we should understand related to risk management:

* **Risk Awareness**: The acknowledgement that risks exist and need to be mitigated.
* **Inherent Risk**: Risk that exists _before_ you apply any security controls or mitigation efforts.
* **Residual Risk**: Risk that remains after controls and mitigations
* **Control Risk**: Risk that exists if in-place controls do not adequately manage them.
* **Risk Appetite**: How much risk an organization is willing to accept.

##### Risk Management Strategies
There are multiple risk management strategies available to an organization. They include:

* **Avoidance**: You can avoid the risk by simply not providing the service or doing risky things.
* **Mitigation**: You implement controls to reduce risks. Can reduce the vulnerabilities or impact
* **Acceptance**: When the cost of a control outweighs risk, you can accept the risk. 
* **Transference**: Transfers or shares the risk with another entity, for example insurance.
* **Cybersecurity Insurance**: More complete compared to regular insurance policies.
