You can verify the integrity with *hashing*. Hashing is a mathematical algorithm performed on data such as a file or message to produces a **fixed-length** hexadecimal string of characters called a hash. 

A key point is that no matter how many times you hash the same data, the result will always be the same, as long as you keep the hashing algorithm the same.

## Hash Versus Checksum
Both are similar. In general hashes are much longer numbers and used in strong cryptographic implementations. A *checksum* is typically a small piece of data, sometimes only 1 or 2 bits, and i sued to quickly verify the integrity of data. 

The main difference is that checksums can check for integrity but are not cryptographically secure. On the other hand, hashes are.

## MD5
*Message Digest 5 (MD5)* is a common hashing algorithm that produces a 128 bit hash value, more commonly shown as a 32 Hex string of characters ranging from 0-9 and a-f. 

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered a long time ago making this hash no longer cryptographically secure, but it is still used to quickly verify the integrity of files. 

## Secure Hash Algorithms
*Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA)* are a group of hashing algorithms with variations grouped into four standards; SHA0, SHA1, SHA2 and SHA3.

* SHA0 is flawed and not used
* SHA1 is an updated version similar to MD5, weaknesses were found and no longer used.
* SHA2 is an improved version and can create 256. 512, 224, and 384 bit hashes.
* SHA3 is an alternative to SHA2, uses a completely different method from SHA2

## HMAC
*HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)* combines a cryptographic hash function with a secret key to verify both data integrity and authenticity. It works by hashing the message twice in a specific structure that incorporates the key, preventing length-extension attacks. The sender computes the HMAC and sends it with the message. The recipient recalculates the HMAC using the received message and the shared secret key. If the computed HMAC matches the received one, the message is verified as untampered and from the legitimate sender. It's widely used in APIs (e.g., HMAC-SHA256) for secure data transmission.

TLDR: Hash message, encrypt hash with secret key, send message along with the HMAC

## Hashing Passwords
Most systems do not store the actual password for an account. Instead, they store a hash of the password. The problem of doing this is that *rainbow tables* will immediately crack common passwords for which their hashes were already computed.

## Hash Collisions
A *hash collision* occurs when the hashing algorithm creates the same hash form different input. MD5 is highly vulnerable to hash collisions attacks.
