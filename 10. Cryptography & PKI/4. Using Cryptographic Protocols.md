Depending one which key is used for encryption in asymmetric encryption will tell you the use of the encryption, if we encrypt with the private key we know it is being used for a digital signature.

## Protecting Email
Cryptography provides two primary methods you can use with email: *digital signatures* and *encryption*. 

The *Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)* uses an encrypted hash of a message. The has is encrypted with the sender's private key. If the receiver can decrypt the digital signature to reveal the hash, it provides the following security benefits.

* **Authentication**. If you can decrypt the hash with the person's public key you know it is the correct sender
* **Non-repudiation**: Only the sender could have encrypted the message with his private key.
* **Integrity**: Recipients know that the received message is the same as the message sent.

Encryption in email can work in two ways, asymmetric encryption could be used through the entire duration but as it has been said it is slower. So normally, a combination of both is done.
The first email will contain the message, and the symmetric key that will be used. The message will  encrypted with the symmetric key and the symmetric key will be encrypted with the receivers public key. The receiver will then decrypt the symmetric key with his private key and then decrypt the message with the recovered key. The rest of the communication will be encrypted using the symmetric key.

*Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)* is one of the most popular standards used to digitally sign and encrypt email. Most email applications that support encryption and digital signatures use S/MIME standards. This protocol uses the asymmetric/symmetric combo and uses the secure mail ports for IMAP, POP3 and SMTP

## HTTPS
TLS is the replacement for SSL. TLS requires certificates issued by [[5. Exploring PKI Components#Certificate Authority|certificate authorities (CAs)]]. TLS encrypts HTTPS traffic, but it can also encrypt other traffic.

Administrators should disable weak cipher suites and weak protocols on servers. When a server has both strong and weak cipher suites, attackers can launch [[1. Identifying Network Attacks#Secure Sockets Layer Stripping.|downgrade attacks]] bypassing the strong cipher suite and exploiting the weak cipher suite. Attacker can use a system that only supports SSL to that the server is forced to use it. Then perform SSL based attacks.

## Blockchain
*Blockchain* is commonly defined as a distributed, decentralized, public ledger. In other words, it is a public record-keeping technology. Banks commonly use ledgers to record transactions such as deposits and withdrawals and blockchain open public ledgers are similar. The word block refers to pieces of digital information (the ledger), such as transactions, and chain refers to a public database. Together they create a database of public records. Each block has three parts:

* Information about a transaction, or transactions, such as the date, time, and amount. 
* Information on the parties involved with the transaction(s). However, this doesn’t include actual names but instead uses a digital signature. 
* A unique hash that distinguishes the block from other blocks.

The hashes of new blocks are **chained** with the hashes of previous blocks. Creating a chain of events.

## Identifying Limitations
When evaluating different algorithms, it is important to consider their possible limitations. The following list shows limitations to consider.

* **Resource Vs Security Constraints**: Encrypting takes a larger amount of space, compared to the plaintext text, about a 40% increase, it is simply not worth it to encrypt everything.
* **Speed and Time**: You generally want a quick algorithm when encrypting and decrypting data. However, when hashing you want a slow algorithm because it slows attackers.
* **Size and Computational Overhead**: Size normally related to the amount of memory needed to encrypt or decrypt data, for servers it would be trivial but no so for smaller devices.
* **Entropy**: Refers to the randomness of the algorithm, more random is more secure. 
* **Predictability**: Random number generators are either pseudo-random number generators or true random number generators. A pseudo-random number generator uses a deterministic algorithm. Meaning that the output can often be predicted
* **Weak Keys**: Even the strongest algorithms can be easily cracked when weak keys are used. A weak key is a short or small key.
* **Longevity**: How long you can expect to use an algorithm. This is typically related to the expected improvements in processing power. By doubling the key size, it increases the longevity of the algorithm.
* **Reuse**: When using symmetric encryption, the same keys shouldn’t be reused. This is especially true with stream ciphers. If any key is used twice in the same stream, the algorithm is vulnerable to attacks. [[3. Securing Wireless Networks#Wireless Cryptographic Protocols|WEP]] was vulnerable to this. 
* **Plaintext Attack**: If the attacker knows the plaintext of an intercepted encrypted message, he can find out how it was encrypted, and he could perform decryption on the remaining packets.
