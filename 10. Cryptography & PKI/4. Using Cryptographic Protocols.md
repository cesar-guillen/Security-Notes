Depending one which key is used for encryption in asymmetric encryption will tell you the use of the encryption, if we encrypt with the private key we know it is being used for a digital signature.

## Protecting Email
Cryptography provides two primary methods you can use with email: *digital signatures* and *encryption*. 

The *Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)* uses an encrypted hash of a message. The has is encrypted with the sender's private key. If the receiver can decrypt the digital signature to reveal the hash, it provides the following security benefits.

* **Authentication**. If you can decrypt the hash with the person's public key you know it is the correct sender
* **Non-repudiation**: Only the sender could have encrypted the message with his private key.
* **Integrity**: Recipients know that the received message is the same as the message sent.

Encryption in email can work in two ways, asymmetric encryption could be used through the entire duration but as it has been said it is slower. So normally, a combination of both is done.
The first email will contain the message, and the symmetric key that will be used. The message will  encrypted with the symmetric key and the symmetric key will be encrypted with the receivers public key. The receiver will then decrypt the symmetric key with his private key and then decrypt the message with the recovered key. The rest of the communication will be encrypted using the symmetric key.

*Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)* is one of the most popular standards used to digitally sign and encrypt email. Most email applications that support encryption and digital signatures use S/MIME standards. This protocol uses the asymmetric/symmetric combo and uses the secure mail ports for IMAP, POP3 and SMTP

## HTTPS
TLS is the replacement for SSL. TLS requires certificates issued by certificate authorities (CAs). TLS encrypts HTTPS traffic, but it can also encrypt other traffic.

Administrators should disable weak cipher suites and weak protocols on servers. When a server has both strong and weak cipher suites, attackers can launch [[1. Identifying Network Attacks#Secure Sockets Layer Stripping.|downgrade attacks]] bypassing the strong cipher suite and exploiting the weak cipher suite. Attacker can use a system that only supports SSL to that the server is forced to use it. Then perform SSL based attacks.

## Blockchain
*Blockchain* is commonly defined as a distributed, decentralized, public ledger. In other words, it is a public record-keeping technology. Banks commonly use ledgers to record transactions such as deposits and withdrawals and blockchain open public ledgers are similar. The word block refers to pieces of digital information (the ledger), such as transactions, and chain refers to a public database. Together they create a database of public records. Each block has three parts:

* Information about a transaction, or transactions, such as the date, time, and amount. 
* Information on the parties involved with the transaction(s). However, this doesn’t include actual names but instead uses a digital signature. 
* A unique hash that distinguishes the block from other blocks.

The hashes of new blocks are **chained** with the hashes of previous blocks. Creating a chain of events.

## Identifying Limitations
When evaluating different algorithms, it is important to consider their possible limitations. The following list shows limitations to consider.

* **Resource Vs Security Constraints**:
